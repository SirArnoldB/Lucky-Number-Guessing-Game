# Lucky-Number-Guessing-Game

## Algorithm:
    - User Inputs the range: lower bound and upper bound.
    - Generate and Store a random integer (Lucky Number) within the range
    - Initialize a while loop.
    - Prompt the user for a guess
    - If the guess  > lucky number, output “Try Again! You guessed too high“
    - Else If the guess < lucky number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too small”
    - And if the user guessed in a minimum number of guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations! ” Output.
    - Else if the user didn’t guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will get “Better Luck Next Time!” output.
